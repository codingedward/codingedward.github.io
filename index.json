[{"content":"The year is 1601. You and your buddies have invested heavily and bought a new sleek ship which you all agreed deserved the name Helena. You are all pumped to sail the world, to meet new people and to see new places.\nHaving prepared everything, you are on the final step of doing calculations to guarantee the safe navigation of Helena and you come down to the expression $ 197598759 \\times 84738549 $ that needs to be evaluated. Unfortunately, you all really suck at multiplication, logarithms are yet to be invented and you\u0026rsquo;re stuck. Oh, no! What do you do?\nThe Solution Now, if you may forgive the rather fictatious depiction of you and your buddies, this was interestingly a problem that sailors and mathematicians faced pre-logarithms invention \u0026ndash; that of estimating products. To solve their problems, they came up with an ingenious way of relating products to trigonometric identities, known as prosthaphaeresis.\nWe recently covered an article on how to derive trigonometric identities and in it, we came across the following identities,\n$$ \\tag{1} \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\frac{\\sin(a+b) + \\sin(a-b)}{2} $$ $$ \\tag{2} \\cos(a)\\cos(b) = \\frac{\\cos(a+b) + \\cos(a-b)}{2} $$ $$ \\tag{3} \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\frac{\\cos(a-b) - \\cos(a+b)}{2} $$\nClearly, this may serve as a way to reduce difficult multiplication problems to calculating sums, differences and the easy division by two if we can tame any values $ x, y $ to be constrained in the domain $ -1 \\leq x, y \\leq 1 $ (the domain of cosine and sine trigonometric functions).\nLuckily, we can always rewrite any numbers in the scientific notation but this time with a twist \u0026ndash; we force the coefficient to be within the range of $ -1 $ and $ 1 $. Using the numbers we came across earlier, we have,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} 197598759 \\times 84738549 \\; \u0026amp; = \\; (1.97598759 \\times 10^{8}) \\times (8.4738549 \\times 10^{7}) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 1.97598759 \\times 8.4738549 \\times 10^{15} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 0.197598759 \\times 0.84738549 \\times 10^{17} \\end{aligned} $$\nNow the problem comes down to calculating $ 0.197598759 \\times 0.84738549 $ and without loss of generality, we can relate the problem to the identity $ (2) $ above. Therefore, we let,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\cos(a) \u0026amp; = 0.197598759 \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow a \u0026amp; = \\cos^{-1}(0.197598759) = 1.371888552 \\\\ \\\\ \\; \\cos(b) \u0026amp; = 0.84738549 \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow b \u0026amp; = \\cos^{-1}(0.84738549) = 0.559754503 \\end{aligned} $$\nWith $ a $ and $ b $ in place, the problem is now reduced to evaluating,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\cos(a+b) + \\cos(a-b)}{2} \u0026amp; = \\frac{\\cos(1.931643055) + \\cos(0.812134049)}{2} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = 0.16744232131184622 \\end{aligned} $$\nWhich on multiplying by $ 10^{17} $ we get $ 16744232131184622 $ which is a rather close approximation of the actual product!\nThe Implementation To those of us who would rather test the algorithm out on their own, here\u0026rsquo;s an implementation:\nPython C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; Java  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34  import math # Convert a value x to the notation a * 10^b # where a \u0026lt;= 1.

While usually you would refer from a table with these identities when you deem it necessary to apply one, it comes in handy to have most of them memorised.\nIntroduction The trigonometric functions are defined on a right angled triangle $ ABC $ for one of the angles of the triangle, in this case $\\alpha$. We start by defining two sides relative to the angle known as the opposite side ($Opp$) and the adjacent side ($Adj$) which is the side that connects the angle to the $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ angle. The third side is always the one opposite to the $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and is known as the hypoteneuse ($Hyp$).\n From this, we can now define the 6 trigonometric functions as ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle using the triangle above.\n$$\\tag{1} \\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\cosec(\\alpha)} = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp} = \\frac{BC}{AB} $$ $$\\tag{2} \\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\sec(\\alpha)} = \\frac{Adj}{Hyp} = \\frac{AC}{AB} $$ $$\\tag{3} \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\cot(\\alpha)} = \\frac{Opp}{Adj} = \\frac{BC}{AC} $$\nWe may also derive an easily accessible relationship between the ratios given by,\n$$\\tag{4} \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{Opp}{Adj} = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp}\\frac{Hyp}{Adj} = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp}\\div\\frac{Adj}{Hyp} = \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha)}{\\cos(\\alpha)} $$\nIt is often useful to graph these functions which helps to visualize and build the intiution behind their behaviour. This graph runs through the values $ \\frac{-3\\pi}{2} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\frac{3\\pi}{2} $,\n From this graph, it may be interesting to find out for which values of $ \\alpha $ the functions are equal. These include, $$\\tag{5} \\cos(\\alpha) = \\sin(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}); \\; \\; \\sin(\\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $$\nAnd using $(4)$ and the relationships in $(5)$, we may derive,\n$$ \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha)}{\\cos(\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\cos(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\sin(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2})} = \\cot(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $$\nCompound angle (or Ptolemy\u0026rsquo;s) identities We will now start by deriving trigonometric identities that arise from trigonometric functions applied to a sum of angles.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s start by considering a right-angled triangle $ OAB $ with the angle at $A = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. We denote the angle of the triangle at origin as $ a $ and the angle between the $ y $-axis and the triangle as $ b $. We also define the hypoteneuse of the triangle to be have a size of $ 1 $ units.\nWe now inscribe this triangle in the rectangle $ OCED $ which will prove useful later. We also denote other angles which one can verify by considering that all angles of the rectangle $ OCED $ as well as the angle $ OAB $ are right angles. This gives us the following figure:\n Now, using the formulas,\n$$ \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp} \\; \\Rightarrow \\; Opp = Hyp\\sin(\\theta); $$ $$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{Adj}{Hyp} \\; \\Rightarrow \\; Adj = Hyp\\cos(\\theta); $$\nand the hypoteneuse of size $ 1 $ we have that the lengths $ OA = \\cos(a) $ and $ AB = \\sin(a) $. By using the same formulas, along with the triangles $ AEB $, $ OCA $, and $ OBD $, we can label the lengths of all the other lines on the rectangle $ OCED $ as follows:\n Now considering that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal we have the sides\n  $ OC = EB + BD $, from which we have, $$ \\cos(a)\\cos(b) = \\sin(a)\\sin(b) + \\cos(a+b) $$ $$ \\Rightarrow \\; \\cos(a+b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) $$ $$ \\tag{6} \\Rightarrow \\; \\cos(a \\pm b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\sin(a)\\sin(b) $$\n  $ OD = AE + CA $, from which we have, $$ \\sin(a + b) = \\sin(a)\\cos(b) + \\cos(a)\\sin(b) $$ $$ \\tag{7} \\Rightarrow \\; \\sin(a \\pm b) = \\sin(a)\\cos(b) \\pm \\cos(a)\\sin(b) $$\n  Dividing out $ (7) $ by $ \\cos(a + b) $ we obtain, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\sin(a \\pm b)}{\\cos(a \\pm b)} \u0026amp; = \\; \\frac{\\sin(a)\\cos(b)}{\\cos(a \\pm b)} \\pm \\frac{\\cos(a)\\sin(b)}{\\cos(a \\pm b)} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; \\frac{\\sin(a)\\cos(b)}{\\cos(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\sin(a)\\sin(b)} \\pm \\frac{\\cos(a)\\sin(b)}{\\cos(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\sin(a)\\sin(b)} \\\\ \\; \\end{aligned} $$\nNow if we divide the numerators and the denominators of the RHS of equation above with $ \\cos(a)\\cos(b) $, we obtain:\n$$ \\tag{8} \\tan(a \\pm b) = \\frac{\\tan(a) \\pm \\tan(b)}{1 \\mp \\tan(a)\\tan{b}} $$\nNote that we are able to extend the formulas to handle $ (a - b) $ based on the fact that $ \\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta) $ and $ \\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) $, i.e $ \\sin $ and $ \\cos $ are odd and even functions respectively.\nPythagorean identities Using the same figure we used to derive compound angle formulas, but this time considering just the triangle $ OAB $ we can obtain an identity using Pythagora\u0026rsquo;s theorem,\n so that, we have: $$ \\tag{9} \\cos^2(a) + \\sin^2(a) = 1 $$\nDividing $ (9) $ all through by $ \\cos^2(a) $, we have: $$ \\frac{\\cos^2(a)}{\\cos^2(a)} + \\frac{\\sin^2(a)}{\\cos^2(a)} = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(a)} $$\n$$ \\tag{10} \\Rightarrow \\; 1 + \\tan^2(a) = \\sec^2(a) $$\nWhile dividing all through by $ \\sin^2(a) $, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\cos^2(a)}{\\sin^2(a)} + \\frac{\\sin^2(a)}{\\sin^2(a)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(a)} $$\n$$ \\tag{11} \\Rightarrow \\; \\cot^2(a) + 1 = \\cosec^2(a) $$\nDouble angle identities Using the compound angle cosine identity $ (6) $ when $ a = b $ we will have:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\tag{12} \\cos(2a) \u0026amp; = \\; \\cos^2(a) - \\sin^2(a) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 1 - 2\\sin^2(a) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 2\\cos^2(a) - 1 \\end{aligned} $$\nNote that to obtain the second and third identites of $ \\cos(2a) $ we substite either the value of $ \\sin^2(a) $ or $ \\cos^2(a) $ using $ (9) $.\nUsing the compound angle sine identity $ (7) $ and by making $ a = b $ we have:\n$$ \\tag{13} \\sin(2a) = 2\\sin(a)\\cos(a) $$\nBy making $ a = b $ in $ (8) $, we also have:\n$$ \\tag{14} \\tan(2a) = \\frac{2\\tan(a)}{1 - \\tan^2(a)} $$\nHalf angle identities These identities are obtained by manipulating the double angle identities. We start by supposing that $ a = 2b $. Then,\nFrom $ (12) $, we have\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\cos(2b) \u0026amp; = \\; 2\\cos^2(b) - 1 \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow \\cos^2(b) \u0026amp; = \\; \\frac{1 + \\cos(2b)}{2} \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow \\cos(b) \u0026amp; = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos(2b)}{2}} \\end{aligned} $$\nSince we have made the assumption that $ a = 2b $, this can be rewritten as\n$$ \\tag{15} \\cos(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos(a)}{2}} $$\nUsing $ (12) $ but with identity $\\cos(2a) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(a)$ we can also obtain a similar result for $ \\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) $ to be:\n$$ \\tag{16} \\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{2}} $$\nTo obtain the half angle identity for the $ \\tan $ function,\n We can divide $ (15) $ by $ (16) $ so, that:  $$ \\tag{17} \\tan(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})}{\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{1 + \\cos(a)}} $$\nWe can also use the identities $ \\sin(2a) = 2\\cos(a)\\sin(a) $ along with $ \\cos(2a) = 1 - \\sin^2(a) = \\cos^2(a) - 1 $ (double angle sine and cosine rules) to obtain other versions of the tangent half angle identities.\nThat is, if we multiply both $ \\cos(\\frac{a}{2}) $ and $ \\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) $ (i.e the denominator and the numerator) above with $ 2\\cos(\\frac{a}{2}) $ we would obtain,  $$ \\tag{18} \\tan(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\frac{2\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})}{2\\cos^2(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{2\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})}{1 + 2\\cos^2(\\frac{a}{2}) - 1} = \\; \\frac{\\sin(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2})}{1 + \\cos(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{\\sin(a)}{1 + \\cos(a)} $$\nWe could also multiply both the denominator and the numerator above with $ -2\\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) $ in which case we would obtain,  $$ \\tag{19} \\tan(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\frac{-2\\sin^2(\\frac{a}{2})}{-2\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{1 - 2\\sin^2(\\frac{a}{2}) - 1}{-2\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{\\cos(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2}) - 1}{-\\sin(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{\\sin(a)} $$\nProduct-sum identities Suppose we added $ \\sin(c + d) $ and $ \\sin(c - d) $. Then, by $ (7) $, we would have:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\sin(c+d) + \\sin(c-d) \u0026amp; = \\; \\big(\\sin(c)\\cos(d) + \\cos(c)\\sin(d)\\big) + \\big(\\sin(c)\\cos(d) - \\cos(c)\\sin(d) \\big) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 2\\sin(c)\\cos(d) \\end{aligned} $$\nNow if we make $ c + d = a $ and $ c - d = b $, and by solving for $ a $ and $ b $ we would have:\n$$ \\tag{20} \\sin(a) + \\sin(b) = 2\\sin(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$\nSimilarly, we can obtain results for:\n$$ \\tag{21} \\cos(a) + \\cos(b) = 2\\cos(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$ $$ \\tag{22} \\sin(a) - \\sin(b) = 2\\cos(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$ $$ \\tag{23} \\cos(a) - \\cos(b) = -2\\sin(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$\nProduct identities Now consider the identity $ (20) $, above. We have,\n$$ \\sin(c) + \\sin(d) = 2\\sin(\\frac{c+d}{2})\\cos(\\frac{c-d}{2}) $$\nThis may be rewritten as:\n$$ \\sin(\\frac{c+d}{2})\\cos(\\frac{c-d}{2}) = \\frac{\\sin(c) + \\sin(d)}{2} $$\nAgain, if we suppose that $ \\frac{c+d}{2} = a $ and $ \\frac{c-d}{2} = b $ and solve for $ c $ and $ d $, we would have:\n$$ \\tag{24} \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\frac{\\sin(a+b) + \\sin(a-b)}{2} $$\nSimilarly, we can obtain:\n$$ \\tag{25} \\cos(a)\\cos(b) = \\frac{\\cos(a+b) + \\cos(a-b)}{2} $$ $$ \\tag{26} \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\frac{\\cos(a-b) - \\cos(a+b)}{2} $$\nCosine and sine laws Although these laws are not considered to be trigonometric identities, they will often show up in problems and are worth covering. We will start by deriving the sine law.\nSine law Consider the triangle below,\n We will denote the angles on the triangle with the name of the point on which the angle is formed. For each angle, we also denote the side opposite to it by its lower case letter.\nNow by definition of the $ \\sin $ function, we have:\n$$ \\sin(A) = \\frac{CO}{b}; \\; \\; \\; \\sin(B) = \\frac{CO}{a} $$ $$ \\Rightarrow b\\sin(A) = CO; \\; \\; \\; a\\sin(B) = CO $$\nWhich implies that, $$ b\\sin(A) = a\\sin(B) \\Rightarrow \\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} $$\nThe same argument may be extended to the angle $ C $ at which point we will have,\n$$\\tag{27} \\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(C)} $$\nCosine law To derive the cosine law, we will use the triangle below:\n Let the length $ AO = x $ and $ CO = h $. Then $ OB = c - x $, which means,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} a^2 \u0026amp; = (c - x)^2 + h^2 \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = c^2 - 2cx + x^2 + h^2; \\\\ \\\\ \\; b^2 \u0026amp; = x^2 + h^2 \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow a^2 \u0026amp; = b^2 + c^2 - 2cx \\end{aligned} $$\nBut we also have,\n$$ \\cos(A) = \\frac{x}{b} \\Rightarrow x = b\\cos(A) $$\nWhich if we substite in the equation above, we have, $$\\tag{28} a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos(A) $$\nThe same argument may be extended to the other two angles, so that,\n$$\\tag{29} b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\\cos(B) $$ $$\\tag{30} c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(C) $$\nThis concludes our tour of the trigonometric identities!\n","description":"In this article we will derive all of the trigonometric identities from first principles.","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["math","trigonometry"],"title":"Let's derive trigonometric identities!","uri":"https://njoroge.dev/posts/lets-derive-trigonometric-identities/"},{"content":"My name is Edward Njoroge and currently I\u0026rsquo;m a Fullstack Software Engineer working for a lovely company called Mayflower Weddings Inc. based in Boston, MA.\n I know only one thing, that I do not know. – Socrates.\n What do I live for?

Note that due to the possibility of having non-distinct roots, then $ (2) $ may also be written as,\n$$ f(x) = (x - \\alpha_{1})^{m_{1}} (x - \\alpha_{2})^{m_{2}} (x - \\alpha_{3})^{m_{3}} \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{p})^{m_{p}} = 0 $$\nwhere $ m_{i} $ is the number of times a root $\\alpha_{i}$ is repeated and is known as the multiplicity of $\\alpha_{i}$ and $ p \\le n $.\nVieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas Vieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas establish an interesting relationship between the coefficients of a polynomial and its roots which we will derive here by comparing $ (1) $ to the expanded version of $ (2) $. For the sake of clarity, we will include as much of the calculations as is possible.\nWe start by rewriting $ (1) $ so as to have the component of the polynomial with the highest power with a factor of $ 1 $. The reason for this will be clear later in the process.\n$$ \\tag{3} f(x) = a_{n} (x^{n} + \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}x^{n-1} + \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}}x^{n-2} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{1}}{a_{n}}x + \\frac{a_{0}}{a_{n}}) = 0 $$\nNow, assuming we had factored out the $a_{n}$ in $(2)$ just as we have done above and expanded it by multiplying out the first term, we will obtain,\n$$ f(x) = a_{n}\\big(x^2 - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2})x + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\big) (x - \\alpha_{3}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nBy further expanding this by multiplying out the third term, we will obtain,\n$$ f(x) = a_{n}\\big(x^3 - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{3})x^2 + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3})x + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\big) (x - \\alpha_{4}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nFrom the above equation, there\u0026rsquo;s already a pattern that can be obtained although not entirely obvious. If we were to expand this further all through, we will have,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\tag{4} \\frac{f(x)}{a_{n}} =\\; \u0026amp; \\; x^n \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n})x^{n-1} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{4} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_{n})x^{n-2} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; - (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{4} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n-2}\\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_{n})x^{n-3} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; \\; \\vdots \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; + (-1)^n(\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\cdots\\alpha_{n}) \\\\ \\; = 0 \\end{aligned} $$\nWe will now compare the coefficients of $(3)$ and $(4)$. Note that since these two are equal, the coefficients of $x^i$ should essentially be the equal. For the term with the highest degree, they both have a coefficient equal to $ 1 $ and therefore not very interesting. For the other terms though, we have:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}x^{n-1} \u0026amp; = \\; - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n})x^{n-1} \\\\ \\\\ \\; \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n-1}}x^{n-2} \u0026amp; = \\; + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{4} + \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_{n})x^{n-2} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; \\; \\vdots \\\\ \\; \\frac{a_{0}}{a_{1}} \u0026amp; = \\; (-1)^n \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\cdots\\alpha_{n} \\end{aligned} $$\nThis beautiful pattern is essentially what Vieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas express and may be written as,\n$$ \\frac{a_{n-k}}{a_{n}} = (-1)^n \\sum_{1 \\leq i_{1} \\lt i_{2} \\cdots \\lt i_{k} \\leq n}^{n}\\Big( \\prod_{j=1}^k \\alpha_{i_{j}} \\Big) $$\nConclusion I hope this helps give you the intuition behind the beautiful formulas!\n","description":"Vieta's formulas provide a relation between the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["math","algebra"],"title":"Vieta's formulas in elementary algebra","uri":"https://njoroge.dev/posts/vietas-formulas-in-elementary-algebra/"}]
