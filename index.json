[{"content":"My likeness :)  Hello, my name is Edward and currently I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer working for a lovely company called Mayflower Weddings Inc. based in Boston, MA.    I know only one thing, that I do not know. – Socrates.\n What do I live for? I am an aspiring erudite, relentlessly pursuing after knowledge, seeking, searching, questioning and always willing to learn both new and old ideas alike. Additionally, I enjoy solving problems with the skills I gain with the hope of leaving this place better than I found it.\nAs a software developer, I have mid level skills, having worked on several projects some of which you can see in my portfolio (coming soon). I love C++ with its (humbling?) intricacies and have also worked with C, Java, Python, JavaScript (React and Node), Dart, and PHP/Laravel to name a few (I consider myself a polyglot and have made peace with it). I am equally good at working on Desktop and Web applications having used several frameworks and libraries in both fields. I also greatly enjoy the study of data structures and algorithms as I believe that anything that can be optimized, should be.\nBesides that, I have a general interest in philosophy, mathematics, sociology and psychology.\n","description":"Hugo, the world’s fastest framework for building websites","id":0,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"https://njoroge.dev/about/"},{"content":"Introduction By the fundamental theory of algebra, a general polynomial of the form,\n$$ \\tag{1} f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_{1}x + a_{0} = 0 $$\nhas at least $ n $ complex roots (not necessarily unique). Therefore, given a root $ \\alpha $ of the polynomial, we can rewrite $ (1) $ as,\n$$ f(x) = (x - \\alpha) f^\u0026rsquo;(x) = 0 $$\nwhere $ f^\u0026rsquo;(x) $ is a polynomial of degree $(n - 1)$. Now, by extending this idea to completely factor out $ f^\u0026rsquo;(x) $, we would have,\n$$ \\tag{2} f(x) = (x - \\alpha_{1}) (x - \\alpha_{2}) (x - \\alpha_{3}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nwhere $ \\alpha_{k} $ for $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n $ is the count of the not necessarily distinct roots of $ f(x) $. Note that due to the possibility of having non-distinct roots, then $ (2) $ may also be written as,\n$$ f(x) = (x - \\alpha_{1})^{m_{1}} (x - \\alpha_{2})^{m_{2}} (x - \\alpha_{3})^{m_{3}} \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{p})^{m_{p}} = 0 $$\nwhere $ m_{i} $ is the number of times a root $\\alpha_{i}$ is repeated and is known as the multiplicity of $\\alpha_{i}$ and $ p \\le n $.\nVieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas Vieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas establish an interesting relationship between the coefficients of a polynomial and its roots which we will derive here by comparing $ (1) $ to the expanded version of $ (2) $. For the sake of clarity, we will include as much of the calculations as is possible.\nWe start by rewriting $ (1) $ so as to have the component of the polynomial with the highest power with a factor of $ 1 $. The reason for this will be clear later in the process.\n$$ \\tag{3} f(x) = a_{n} (x^{n} + \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}x^{n-1} + \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}}x^{n-2} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{1}}{a_{n}}x + \\frac{a_{0}}{a_{n}}) = 0 $$\nNow, assuming we had factored out the $a_{n}$ in $(2)$ just as we have done above and expanded it by multiplying out the first term, we will obtain,\n$$ f(x) = a_{n}\\big(x^2 - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2})x + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\big) (x - \\alpha_{3}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nBy further expanding this by multiplying out the third term, we will obtain,\n$$ f(x) = a_{n}\\big(x^3 - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{3})x^2 + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3})x + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\big) (x - \\alpha_{4}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nFrom the above equation, there\u0026rsquo;s already a pattern that can be obtained although not entirely obvious. If we were to expand this further all through, we will have,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\tag{4} \\frac{f(x)}{a_{n}} =\\; \u0026amp; \\; x^n \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n})x^{n-1} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{4} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_{n})x^{n-2} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; - (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{4} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n-2}\\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_{n})x^{n-3} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; + \\cdots \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; + (-1)^n(\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\cdots\\alpha_{n}) \\\\ \\; = 0 \\end{aligned} $$\nWe will now compare the coefficients of $(3)$ and $(4)$. Note that since these two are equal, the coefficients of $x^i$ should essentially be the equal. For the term with the highest degree, they both have a coefficient equal to $ 1 $ and therefore not very interesting. For the other terms though, we have:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}x^{n-1} \u0026amp; = \\; - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n})x^{n-1} \\\\ \\\\ \\; \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n-1}}x^{n-2} \u0026amp; = \\; + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{4} + \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3} + \\cdots + \\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_{n})x^{n-2} \\\\ \\; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\\\ \\\\ \\; \\frac{a_{0}}{a_{1}} \u0026amp; = \\; \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\cdots\\alpha_{n} \\end{aligned} $$\nThis beautiful pattern is essentially what Vieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas express and may be written as,\n$$ \\frac{a_{n-k}}{a_{n}} = (-1)^n \\sum_{1 \\leq i_{1} \\lt i_{2} \\cdots \\lt i_{k} \\leq n}^{n}\\Big( \\prod_{j=1}^k \\alpha_{i_{j}} \\Big) $$\nConclusion Although this is does not constitute a formal proof of Vieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas, I hope it helps give you the intuition behind the seemingly complex relationship.\n","description":"Vieta's formulas provide a relation between the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["math","algebra"],"title":"Vieta's formulas in elementary algebra","uri":"https://njoroge.dev/posts/vietas-formulas-in-elementary-algebra/"}]
