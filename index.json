[{"content":"Hello, in this post we\u0026rsquo;ll are going to derive the trigonometric identities. While usually you would refer from a table with these identities when you deem it necessary to apply one, it comes in handy to have most of these memorised.\nIntroduction The trigonometric functions are defined for on a right angled triangle $ ABC $ for one of the angles of the triangle, in this case $\\alpha$. We start by defining two sides relative to the angle know as the opposite side ($Opp$) and the adjacent side ($Adj$) which is the side that connects the angle to the $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ angle. The third side is always the one opposite to the $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and is known as the hypoteneuse ($Hyp$).\n From this, we can now define the 6 trigonometric functions as ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle using the triangle above.\n$$\\tag{1} \\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\cosec(\\alpha)} = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp} = \\frac{BC}{AB} $$ $$\\tag{2} \\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\sec(\\alpha)} = \\frac{Adj}{Hyp} = \\frac{AC}{AB} $$ $$\\tag{3} \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\cot(\\alpha)} = \\frac{Opp}{Adj} = \\frac{BC}{AC} $$\nWe may also derive an easily accessible relationship between the ratios given by,\n$$\\tag{4} \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{Opp}{Adj} = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp}\\frac{Hyp}{Adj} = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp}\\div\\frac{Adj}{Hyp} = \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha)}{\\cos(\\alpha)} $$\nIt is often useful to graph these functions which helps to visualize and build the intiution behind their behaviour. This graph runs through the values $ \\frac{-3\\pi}{2} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\frac{3\\pi}{2} $,\n From this graph, it may be interesting to find out for which values of $ \\alpha $ the functions are equal. These include, $$\\tag{5} \\cos(\\alpha) = \\sin(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}); \\; \\; \\sin(\\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $$\nAnd using $(4)$ and the relationships in $(5)$, we may derive,\n$$ \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha)}{\\cos(\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\cos(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\sin(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2})} = \\cot(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) $$\nCompound angle (or Ptolemy\u0026rsquo;s) identities We will now switch to deriving trigonometric identities that arise from trigonometric functions applied to a sum of angles.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s start by considering a right-angled triangle $ OAB $ with the angle at $A = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $. We denote the angle of the triangle at origin as $ a $ and the angle between the $ y $-axis and the triangle as $ b $. We also define the hypoteneuse of the triangle to be have a size of $ 1 $ units.\nWe now inscribe this triangle in the rectangle $ OCED $ which we will prove useful later. We also denote other angles which one can verify by considering that that all angles of the rectangle $ OCED $ as well as the angle $ OAB $ are right angles. This gives us the following figure:\n Now, using the formulas,\n$$ \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{Opp}{Hyp} \\; \\Rightarrow \\; Opp = Hyp\\sin(\\theta); $$ $$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{Adj}{Hyp} \\; \\Rightarrow \\; Adj = Hyp\\cos(\\theta); $$\nand the hypoteneuse of size $ 1 $ we have that the lengths $ OA = \\cos(a) $ and $ AB = \\sin(a) $. By using the same formulas, along with the triangles $ AEB $, $ OCA $, and $ OBD $, we can label all the other lines on the rectangle $ OCED $ as follows:\n Now considering that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal we have the sides\n  $ OC = EB + BD $, from which we have, $$ \\cos(a)\\cos(b) = \\sin(a)\\sin(b) + \\cos(a+b) $$ $$ \\Rightarrow \\; \\cos(a+b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) $$ $$ \\tag{6} \\Rightarrow \\; \\cos(a \\pm b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\sin(a)\\sin(b) $$\n  $ OD = AE + CA $, from which we have, $$ \\sin(a + b) = \\sin(a)\\cos(b) + \\cos(a)\\sin(b) $$ $$ \\tag{7} \\Rightarrow \\; \\sin(a \\pm b) = \\sin(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\cos(a)\\sin(b) $$\n  Dividing out $ (6) $ by $ \\cos(a + b) $ we obtain, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\cos(a \\pm b)}{\\sin(a \\pm b)} \u0026amp; = \\; \\frac{\\cos(a)\\cos(b)}{\\sin(a \\pm b)} \\mp \\frac{\\sin(a)\\sin(b)}{\\sin(a \\pm b)} \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; \\frac{\\cos(a)\\cos(b)}{\\sin(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\cos(a)\\sin(b)} \\mp \\frac{\\sin(a)\\sin(b)}{\\sin(a)\\cos(b) \\mp \\cos(a)\\sin(b)} \\\\ \\; \\end{aligned} $$\nNow if we divide the equation above with $ \\cos(a)\\cos(b) $, we obtain:\n$$ \\tag{8} \\tan(a \\pm b) = \\frac{\\tan(a) \\pm \\tan(b)}{1 \\mp \\tan(a)\\tan{b}} $$\nNote that we are able to extend the formulas to handle $ (a - b) $ based on the fact that $ \\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta) $ and $ \\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) $, i.e $ \\sin $ and $ \\cos $ are odd and even functions respectively.\nPythagorean identities Using the same figure we used to derive compound angle formulas, but this time considering just the triangle $ OAB $ we can obtain an identity using Pythagora\u0026rsquo;s theorem,\n so that, we have: $$ \\tag{9} \\cos^2(a) + \\sin^2(a) = 1 $$\nDividing $ (9) $ all through by $ \\cos^2(a) $, we have: $$ \\frac{\\cos^2(a)}{\\cos^2(a)} + \\frac{\\sin^2(a)}{\\cos^2(a)} = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(a)} $$\n$$ \\tag{10} \\Rightarrow \\; 1 + \\tan^2(a) = \\sec^2(a) $$\nWhile dividing all through by $ \\sin^2(a) $, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\cos^2(a)}{\\sin^2(a)} + \\frac{\\sin^2(a)}{\\sin^2(a)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(a)} $$\n$$ \\tag{11} \\Rightarrow \\; \\cot^2(a) + 1 = \\cosec^2(a) $$\nDouble angle identities Using the compound angle cosine identity $ (6) $ we can assume that $ a = b $ and we will have:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\tag{12} \\cos(2a) \u0026amp; = \\; \\cos^2(a) - \\sin^2(a) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 1 - 2\\sin^2(a) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 2\\cos^2(a) - 1 \\end{aligned} $$\nNote that to obtain the second and third identites of $ \\cos(2a) $ we substite either the value of $ \\sin^2(a) $ or $ \\cos^2(a) $ using $ (9) $.\nUsing the compound angle sine identity $ (7) $ we also make $ a = b $ and we have:\n$$ \\tag{13} \\sin(2a) = 2\\sin(a)\\cos(a) $$\nIf we make the same assumption $ a = b $ in $ (8) $, we have:\n$$ \\tag{14} \\tan(2a) = \\frac{2\\tan(a)}{1 - \\tan^2(a)} $$\nHalf angle identities These are obtained by manipulating the double angle identities. We start by supposing that $ a = 2b $. Then,\nFrom $ (12) $, we have\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\cos(2b) \u0026amp; = \\; 2\\cos^2(b) - 1 \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow \\cos^2(b) \u0026amp; = \\; \\frac{1 + \\cos(2b)}{2} \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow \\cos(b) \u0026amp; = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos(2b)}{2}} \\end{aligned} $$\nSince we have made the assumption that $ a = 2b $, this can be rewritten as\n$$ \\tag{15} \\cos(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos(a)}{2}} $$\nUsing $ (12) $ but with identity $\\cos(2a) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(a)$ we can also obtain a similar result for $ \\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) $ to be:\n$$ \\tag{16} \\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{2}} $$\nTo obtain the half angle identity for the $ \\tan $ function,\n We can divide $ (15) $ by $ (16) $ so, that:  $$ \\tag{17} \\tan(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})}{\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{1 + \\cos(a)}} $$\nWe can also use the identities $ \\sin(2a) = 2\\cos(a)\\sin(a) $ along with $ \\cos(2a) = 1 - \\sin^2(a) = \\cos^2(a) - 1 $ (double angle sine and cosine rules) to obtain other versions of the tangent half angle identities.\nThat is, if we multiply both $ \\cos(\\frac{a}{2}) $ and $ \\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) $ (i.e the denominator and the numerator) above with $ 2\\cos(\\frac{a}{2}) $ we would obtain,  $$ \\tag{18} \\tan(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\frac{2\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})}{2\\cos^2(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{2\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})}{1 + 2\\cos^2(\\frac{a}{2}) - 1} = \\; \\frac{\\sin(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2})}{1 + \\cos(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{\\sin(a)}{1 + \\cos(a)} $$\nWe could also multiply both the denominator and the numerator above with $ -2\\sin(\\frac{a}{2}) $ in which we would obtain,  $$ \\tag{19} \\tan(\\frac{a}{2}) = \\frac{-2\\sin^2(\\frac{a}{2})}{-2\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{1 - 2\\sin^2(\\frac{a}{2}) - 1}{-2\\sin(\\frac{a}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{\\cos(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2}) - 1}{-\\sin(2\\cdot\\frac{a}{2})} = \\; \\frac{1 - \\cos(a)}{\\sin(a)} $$\nProduct-sum identities Suppose we added $ \\sin(c + d) $ and $ \\sin(c - d) $. Then, by $ (7) $, we would have:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\sin(c+d) + \\sin(c-d) \u0026amp; = \\; \\big(\\sin(c)\\cos(d) + \\cos(c)\\sin(d)\\big) + \\big(\\sin(c)\\cos(d) - \\cos(c)\\sin(d) \\big) \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = \\; 2\\sin(c)\\cos(d) \\end{aligned} $$\nNow if we make $ c + d = a $ and $ c - d = b $, and solving for $ a $ and $ b $ we would have:\n$$ \\tag{20} \\sin(a) + \\sin(b) = 2\\sin(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$\nSimilarly, we can obtain results for:\n$$ \\tag{21} \\cos(a) + \\cos(b) = 2\\cos(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\cos(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$ $$ \\tag{22} \\sin(a) - \\sin(b) = 2\\cos(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$ $$ \\tag{23} \\cos(a) - \\cos(b) = -2\\sin(\\frac{a+b}{2})\\sin(\\frac{a-b}{2}) $$\nProduct identities Now consider the identity $ (20) $, above. We have,\n$$ \\sin(c) + \\sin(d) = 2\\sin(\\frac{c+d}{2})\\cos(\\frac{c-d}{2}) $$\nThis may be rewritten as:\n$$ \\sin(\\frac{c+d}{2})\\cos(\\frac{c-d}{2}) = \\frac{\\sin(c) + \\sin(d)}{2} $$\nAgain, if we suppose that $ \\frac{c+d}{2} = a $ and $ \\frac{c-d}{2} = b $ and solve for $ c $ and $ d $, we would have:\n$$ \\tag{24} \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\frac{\\sin(a+b) + \\sin(a-b)}{2} $$\nSimilarly, we can obtain:\n$$ \\tag{25} \\cos(a)\\cos(b) = \\frac{\\cos(a+b) + \\cos(a-b)}{2} $$ $$ \\tag{26} \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\frac{\\cos(a-b) - \\cos(a-b)}{2} $$\nCosine and sine laws Although these laws are not considered to be trigonometric identities, they will often show up in problems and are worth covering. We will start by deriving the sine law.\nSine law Consider the triangle below,\n We will denote the angles on the triangle with the name of the point on which the angle is formed. For each angle, we also denote the side opposite to it by its lower case letter.\nNow by definition of the $ \\sin $ function, we have:\n$$ \\sin(A) = \\frac{CO}{b}; \\; \\; \\; \\sin(B) = \\frac{CO}{a} $$ $$ \\Rightarrow b\\sin(A) = CO; \\; \\; \\; a\\sin(B) = CO $$\nWhich implies that, $$ b\\sin(A) = a\\sin(B) \\Rightarrow \\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} $$\nThe same argument may be extended to the angle $ C $ at which point we will have,\n$$\\tag{27} \\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(C)} $$\nCosine law To derive the cosine law, we will use the triangle below:\n Let the length $ AO = x $ and $ CO = h $. Then $ OB = c - x $, which means,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} a^2 \u0026amp; = (c - x)^2 + h^2 \\\\ \\; \u0026amp; = c^2 - 2cx + x^2 + h^2; \\\\ \\\\ \\; b^2 \u0026amp; = x^2 + h^2 \\\\ \\; \\Rightarrow a^2 \u0026amp; = b^2 + c^2 - 2cx \\end{aligned} $$\nBut we also have,\n$$ \\cos(A) = \\frac{x}{b} \\Rightarrow x = b\\cos(A) $$\nWhich if we substite in the equation above, we have, $$\\tag{28} a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos(A) $$\nThe same argument may be extended to the other two angles, so that,\n$$\\tag{29} b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\\cos(B) $$ $$\\tag{30} c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(C) $$\nThis concludes a tour of the trigonometric identities!\n","description":"Here we will derive all of the trigonometric identities that prove to be rather useful in mathematics especially in calculus","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["math","trigonometry"],"title":"Let's derive trigonometric identities!","uri":"https://njoroge.dev/posts/lets-derive-trigonometric-identities/"},{"content":"My likeness :)  Hello, my name is Edward and currently I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer working for a lovely company called Mayflower Weddings Inc. based in Boston, MA.

Therefore, given a root $ \\alpha $ of the polynomial, we can rewrite $ (1) $ as,\n$$ f(x) = (x - \\alpha) f^\u0026rsquo;(x) = 0 $$\nwhere $ f^\u0026rsquo;(x) $ is a polynomial of degree $(n - 1)$. Now, by extending this idea to completely factor out $ f^\u0026rsquo;(x) $, we would have,\n$$ \\tag{2} f(x) = (x - \\alpha_{1}) (x - \\alpha_{2}) (x - \\alpha_{3}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nwhere $ \\alpha_{k} $ for $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n $ is the count of the not necessarily distinct roots of $ f(x) $. Note that due to the possibility of having non-distinct roots, then $ (2) $ may also be written as,\n$$ f(x) = (x - \\alpha_{1})^{m_{1}} (x - \\alpha_{2})^{m_{2}} (x - \\alpha_{3})^{m_{3}} \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{p})^{m_{p}} = 0 $$\nwhere $ m_{i} $ is the number of times a root $\\alpha_{i}$ is repeated and is known as the multiplicity of $\\alpha_{i}$ and $ p \\le n $.\nVieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas Vieta\u0026rsquo;s formulas establish an interesting relationship between the coefficients of a polynomial and its roots which we will derive here by comparing $ (1) $ to the expanded version of $ (2) $. For the sake of clarity, we will include as much of the calculations as is possible.\nWe start by rewriting $ (1) $ so as to have the component of the polynomial with the highest power with a factor of $ 1 $. The reason for this will be clear later in the process.\n$$ \\tag{3} f(x) = a_{n} (x^{n} + \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}x^{n-1} + \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}}x^{n-2} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_{1}}{a_{n}}x + \\frac{a_{0}}{a_{n}}) = 0 $$\nNow, assuming we had factored out the $a_{n}$ in $(2)$ just as we have done above and expanded it by multiplying out the first term, we will obtain,\n$$ f(x) = a_{n}\\big(x^2 - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2})x + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\big) (x - \\alpha_{3}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nBy further expanding this by multiplying out the third term, we will obtain,\n$$ f(x) = a_{n}\\big(x^3 - (\\alpha_{1} + \\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{3})x^2 + (\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2} + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{3} + \\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3})x + \\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\alpha_{3}\\big) (x - \\alpha_{4}) \\cdots (x - \\alpha_{n}) = 0 $$\nFrom the above equation, there\u0026rsquo;s already a pattern that can be obtained although not entirely obvious.
